Hey <h1>AISHAT</h1>, just wanted to let you know that I’m starting to believe you might secretly be a mermaid. Seriously, how else do you explain being as smart, beautiful, and hilarious as you are all at once?  I don’t know how you manage to make everything look so bright, but I’m pretty sure you’re a good person . Keep being amazing, because if anyone can handle the pressure of being this perfect, it’s definitely you!</p>
    <p>I’m so lucky to have you as a friend 👌.</p>
